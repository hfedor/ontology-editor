[[custom-queries]]
= Custom queries

Spring Data Neo4j, like all the other Spring Data modules, allows you to specify custom queries in you repositories.
Those come in handy if you cannot express the finder logic via derived query functions.

Because Spring Data Neo4j works heavily record-oriented under the hood, it is important to keep this in mind and not build up a result set with multiple records for the same "root node".

TIP: Please have a look in the FAQ as well to learn about alternative forms of using custom queries from repositories, especially
how to use custom queries with custom mappings: <<faq.custom-queries-and-custom-mappings>>.

[[custom-queries.for-relationships]]
== Queries with relationships

[[custom-queries.for-relationships.cartesian-product]]
=== Beware of the cartesian product

Assuming you have a query like `MATCH (m:Movie{title: 'The Matrix'})<-[r:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person) return m,r,p` that results into something like this:

.Multiple records (shortened)
----
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| m        | r                                    | p                                      |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (:Movie) | [:ACTED_IN {roles: ["Emil"]}]        | (:Person {name: "Emil Eifrem"})        |
| (:Movie) | [:ACTED_IN {roles: ["Agent Smith"]}] | (:Person {name: "Hugo Weaving})        |
| (:Movie) | [:ACTED_IN {roles: ["Morpheus"]}]    | (:Person {name: "Laurence Fishburne"}) |
| (:Movie) | [:ACTED_IN {roles: ["Trinity"]}]     | (:Person {name: "Carrie-Anne Moss"})   |
| (:Movie) | [:ACTED_IN {roles: ["Neo"]}]         | (:Person {name: "Keanu Reeves"})       |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
----

The result from the mapping would be most likely unusable.
If this would get mapped into a list, it will contain duplicates for the `Movie` but this movie will only have one relationship.

[[custom-queries.for-relationships.one.record]]
=== Getting one record per root node

To get the right object(s) back, it is required to _collect_ the relationships and related nodes in the query: `MATCH (m:Movie{title: 'The Matrix'})<-[r:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person) return m,collect(r),collect(p)`

.Single record (shortended)
----
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| m        | collect(r)                     | collect(p)                 |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (:Movie) | [[:ACTED_IN], [:ACTED_IN], ...]| [(:Person), (:Person),...] |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
----

With this result as a single record it is possible for Spring Data Neo4j to add all related nodes correctly to the root node.

[[custom-queries.parameters]]
== Parameters in custom queries

You do this exactly the same way as in a standard Cypher query issued in the Neo4j Browser or the Cypher-Shell,
with the `$` syntax (from Neo4j 4.0 on upwards, the old `{foo}` syntax for Cypher parameters has been removed from the database).

[source,java,indent=0]
.ARepository.java
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/documentation/repositories/domain_events/ARepository.java[tags=standard-parameter]
----
<.> Here we are referring to the parameter by its name.
You can also use `$0` etc. instead.

NOTE: You need to compile your Java 8+ project with `-parameters` to make named parameters work without further annotations.
The Spring Boot Maven and Gradle plugins do this automatically for you.
If this is not feasible for any reason, you can either add
`@Param`  and specify the name explicitly or use the parameters index.

Mapped entities (everything with a `@Node`) passed as parameter to a function that is annotated with
a custom query will be turned into a nested map.
The following example represents the structure as Neo4j parameters.

Given are a `Movie`, `Person` and `Actor` classes annotated as shown in <<movie-model, the movie model>>:

[[movie-model]]
[source,java]
."Standard" movies model
----
@Node
public final class Movie {

    @Id
    private final String title;

    @Property("tagline")
    private final String description;

    @Relationship(value = "ACTED_IN", direction = Direction.INCOMING)
    private final List<Actor> actors;

    @Relationship(value = "DIRECTED", direction = Direction.INCOMING)
    private final List<Person> directors;
}

@Node
public final class Person {

    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private final Long id;

    private final String name;

    private Integer born;

    @Relationship("REVIEWED")
    private List<Movie> reviewed = new ArrayList<>();
}

@RelationshipProperties
public final class Actor {

	@Id @GeneratedValue
	private final Long id;

    @TargetNode
    private final Person person;

    private final List<String> roles;
}

interface MovieRepository extends Neo4jRepository<Movie, String> {

    @Query("MATCH (m:Movie {title: $movie.__id__})\n"
           + "MATCH (m) <- [r:DIRECTED|REVIEWED|ACTED_IN] - (p:Person)\n"
           + "return m, collect(r), collect(p)")
    Movie findByMovie(@Param("movie") Movie movie);
}
----

Passing an instance of `Movie` to the repository method above, will generate the following Neo4j map parameter:

A node is represented by a map. The map will always contain `__id__`  which is the mapped id property.
Under `__labels__` all labels, static and dynamic, will be available.
All properties - and type of relationships - appear in those maps as they would appear in the graph when the entity would
have been written by SDN.
Values will have the correct Cypher type and won't need further conversion.

All relationships are lists of maps. Dynamic relationships will be resolved accordingly.
If an entity has a relationship with the same type to different types of others nodes, they will all appear in the same list.
If you need such a mapping and also have the need to work with those custom parameters, you have to unroll it accordingly.
One way to do this are correlated subqueries (Neo4j 4.1+ required).

[[custom-queries.spel]]
== Spring Expression Language in custom queries

{spring-framework-ref}/core.html#expressions[Spring Expression Language (SpEL)] can be used in custom queries inside `:#{}`.
This is the standard Spring Data way of defining a block of text inside a query that undergoes SpEL evaluation.

The following example basically defines the same query as above, but uses a `WHERE` clause to avoid even more curly braces:

[source,java,indent=0]
[[custom-queries-with-spel-parameter-example]]
.ARepository.java
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/documentation/repositories/domain_events/ARepository.java[tags=spel]
----

The SpEL blocked starts with `:#{` and than refers to the given `String` parameters by name (`#pt1`).
Don't confuse this with the above Cypher syntax!
The SpEL expression concatenates both parameters into one single value that is eventually passed on to the <<neo4j-client>>.
The SpEL block ends with `}`.

SpEL also solves two additional problems. We provide two extensions that allow to pass in a `Sort` object into custom queries.
Remember <<custom-queries-with-page-and-slice-examples>> from <<faq.custom-queries-with-page-and-slice,custom queries>>?
With the `orderBy` extension you can pass in a `Pageable` with a dynamic sort to a custom query:

[[custom-queries.spel.source]]
[source,java]
.orderBy-Extension
----
import org.springframework.data.domain.Pageable;
import org.springframework.data.domain.Sort;
import org.springframework.data.neo4j.repository.Neo4jRepository;
import org.springframework.data.neo4j.repository.query.Query;

public interface MyPersonRepository extends Neo4jRepository<Person, Long> {

    @Query(""
        + "MATCH (n:Person) WHERE n.name = $name RETURN n "
        + ":#{orderBy(#pageable)} SKIP $skip LIMIT $limit" // <.>
    )
    Slice<Person> findSliceByName(String name, Pageable pageable);

    @Query(""
        + "MATCH (n:Person) WHERE n.name = $name RETURN n :#{orderBy(#sort)}" // <.>
    )
    List<Person> findAllByName(String name, Sort sort);
}
----
<.> A `Pageable` has always the name `pageable` inside the SpEL context.
<.> A `Sort` has always the name `sort` inside the SpEL context.

The `literal` extension can be used to make things like labels or relationship-types "dynamic" in custom queries.
Neither labels nor relationship types can be parameterized in Cypher, so they must be given literal.

[source,java]
.literal-Extension
----
interface BaseClassRepository extends Neo4jRepository<Inheritance.BaseClass, Long> {

    @Query("MATCH (n:`:#{literal(#label)}`) RETURN n") // <.>
    List<Inheritance.BaseClass> findByLabel(String label);
}
----
<.> The `literal` extension will be replaced with the literal value of the evaluated parameter.

Here, the `literal` value has been used to match dynamically on a Label.
If you pass in `SomeLabel` as a parameter to the method, `MATCH (n:``SomeLabel``) RETURN n`
will be generated. Ticks have been added to correctly escape values. SDN won't do this
for you as this is probably not what you want in all cases.
